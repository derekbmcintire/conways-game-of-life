## Warning

When it comes to the Git Happens exercise, it should be heavily stressed that developers should not use this `git reset` command after this exercise is over for their own purposes.

## A Brief Description of Each Exercise

1.  Caveman Coder: Whiteboard only, switch with another team after 30 minutes.

1.  Navigator-Driver: One types, the other dictates; switch every 15 minutes.

1.  Silent Coder: No talking allowed in pair.

1.  Flat Files: No nested conditionals!

1.  Sandi's Rules: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers

1.  Git Happens: Randomly during the exercise, lose any uncommitted code by running `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.
  * **Note**: This is not a command you should be using except for this execerise!!!


1.  Hot Potato: Only one can work at a time, switch every 5 minutes, no communicating, delete uncommitted code.

1.  Many to one: One brave soul following the groups instructions.

1.  Free-for-all: No constraints, figure out how to work together!
